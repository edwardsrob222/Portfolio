<h3>Robbie Edwards' Portfolio</h3>
  <p> I worked for my family's retail business, Draisen Edwards Music, from 2005-2007 and 2010-2018. Attended Winthrop University from 2007-2008, and graduated with a Bachelor's of Fine Arts at Lander University in 2010. After my family sold the business in 2018, I chose to attend Carolina Code School to start a new career path. I have many hobbies that also keep me busy. I have been performing as a semi-professional musician for over 15 years and have played with many bands. My current band is The Grateful Brothers based out of Greenville, SC. It is a Grateful Dead/Allman Brothers tribute band. Painting is another passion. I love to create art with bright colors and high contrast. Hiking, fishing, camping, and going to music festivals are also things I enjoy doing.</p>
